      <p>
        <strong><u>Overview</strong></u><br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis project was one of my class project, me and my partner followed through
        sections of this Pintos project that was meant to develop a small OS from 
        the very core of operating systems: the Kernel. 
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn this project, we were assigned to complete 3 sections of the Pintos project.
        They were alarm clock, priority scheduling, and advanced scheduler.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br><u><strong>Alarm clock</strong></u><br>
        Alarm clock is relatively simple. In the original implementation that was cloned
        from the Pintos project, and the function <strong><i>timer_sleep()</i></strong>  was 
        using a mechanism called busy wait. A function that busy waits will take up CPU time
        just to run through loops to check if the awaited ticks have arrived. So to avoid using
        busy wait, we opted to put a process to sleep when they called the <strong><i>timer_sleep()</i></strong>
        function and store its id in a list for later when we want to wake them up.
        Then we implemented in the function <strong><i>timer_interrupt()</i></strong>, which are
        called as an event handler whenever the hardware tick caused an interrupt, to check if there 
        are any process that had reached the tick they're waiting for and release them back to the 
        ready queue so the scheduler can start scheduling CPU time to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br><u><strong>Priority Scheduling</strong></u><br>
        Priority Scheduling is a scheduling algorithm that helps the scheduler decide which
        process gets to run on the CPU next. In the original Pintos implementation, the scheduler
        was using the round-robin algorithm that circulates through the processes in the ready queue
        to run in CPU. In the new implementation, all processes will be assigned a priority value when 
        they are created: Initialized to 32. Then the Scheduler will find the highest priority process 
        and have them run in the CPU before the other lower priority process. In the case of equal priorities, 
        the scheduler would choose the round-robin method among the processes with the same priority.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br><u><strong>Sub section: Synchronization</strong></u>
        Throughout the implementation of the three sections, we had to implement some objects to 
        support synchronization throughout our code to prevent situations like the race condition. 
        In the provided Pintos code locks, semaphores, and condition variables are given to help 
        maintain synchronization throughout sensitive codes that could be accessed by multiple 
        different processes at the same time. These synchronization tools are often shared among multiple 
        processes, and we need to decide how the scheduler would react when different process with 
        different priorities goes to sleep while waiting on one of these tools. These tools are 
        modified so that when a process tries to take a lock(will just be using lock as an umbrella term onward), 
        it will either get the lock or be put to sleep until the process that had the lock releases it. 
        At the moment of releasing the lock, the process would look into who else is waiting on the lock and 
        choose the highest priority process to place in the ready queue and ask the scheduler to check if 
        the current running process is still highest priority.
      </p>
      <p><br><strong><u>Continuation of Priority Scheduler</u></strong></p>
      <img
        src="img/priority_inversion.JPG"
        alt="img of dynamic memory"
        class="prio_img"
      />
      <P>
        With the tools of synchronization implemented, there is another potential issue to be addressed:
         priority inversion. Priority inversion happends when a low priority process first came in and took
         a lock, then was switched out of CPU by a high priority process that reached to the code where it 
         attempted to grab the lock owned by the low priority process. The high priority process would be 
         sent to sleep to wait for the lock. Then a process with priority in between high and low, say 
         medium priority, came into the ready queue. This medium process will be running before the low 
         priority process which has the lock necessary for the high priority process. So to ensure that the 
         low priority process gets to run until it releases the lock, the high priority process should donate 
         its priority to low priority process so it can execute before any other process whose priority is lower 
         than the high priority process.
      </P>
      <p>
        The thing I just explained above is called a priority donation. This is dealt with in the synchronization 
        tools where we donates priority to lower priority process when grabbing locks. This "inheritance" of 
        priority could happen in a chain where higher priority process keeps coming in and donating their priority 
        to the lower priority process, which will propogate all the way down in the chain of donation. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <br><u><strong>Advanced Scheduler</strong></u><br>
        Admittedly, I personally did not put in much work into this section(unlick the other ones), most of the work
        in this section has to be credited to my partner <a href="https://github.com/tonyliu02" target="_blank">Tony Liu</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
         Our advanced scheduler operates separately to the priority scheduler that we implemented above. 
        This advanced scheduler is called multi-layer feedback queue(MLFQs), and it basically is multiple 
        queues that stores different processes base on their "niceness" which is how often has it occupied 
        the CPU. The processes with high niceness will yield to other threads and have lower priority, and 
        priocesses with low niceness will have a higher priority and therefore be less likely to yield the CPU.
        We use variables of niceness, recent_cpu, load_avg, and priority to evaluate which process will be running
        next and we update the priorities and niceness accordingly.<br><br>It is regrettable that I did not 
        went into further detail with my partner at the time, I was juggling this project and 3 other upper-division
        classes and I couldn't provide much help to my partner there. So I am unable to go into greater detail of
        this advanced scheduler.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br><u><strong>After Thought/Reflection</strong></u><br>
        The project helped reinforced the concepts of synchronization and different kinds of process scheduler
        for me. I personally learned how to explore the pre-existing codes to deduce what are the functionality
        of each function and how to augment them to implement new things while passing sanity tests. Previous to This
        project, I have always started from scratch or been provided a skeletal structure of a code. It was a challenge 
        to have to go through all different sort of files and read through each function in great detail to be able to find
        places that needed some more code added for our purpose.
